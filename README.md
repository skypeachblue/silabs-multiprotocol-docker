# Docker Version of SiliconLabs Zigbee/OpenThread Multiprotocol Add-on Home Assistant Add-on

Zigbee/OpenThread Multiprotocol container for Silicon Labs based radios 
such as SONOFF ZBDongle-E.

## About

Allows you to use Zigbee and OpenThread protocol simultaneous on a 
single Silicon Labs based radio. The radio needs the RCP Multi-PAN firmware 
installed to support multiple IEEE 802.15.4 Personal Area Networks (PAN).

## Usage

The docker container requires access to your local Home Assistant API.
For this, a long-lived access token is needed.
This token can be generated by navigating to `http://<your-local-homeassistant-url>/profile/security` and clicking `Create token` at the bottom.

Configure your local URL and access token inside the docker-compose.yml file.

Then build the docker image: `docker build -t silabs-multiprotocol .`

And finally create the container: `docker compose up -d`
